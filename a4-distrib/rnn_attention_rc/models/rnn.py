        Parameters
        ----------
        passage: Variable(LongTensor)
            A Variable(LongTensor) of shape (batch_size, passage_length)
            representing the words in the passage for each batch.

        question: Variable(LongTensor)
            A Variable(LongTensor) of shape (batch_size, question_length)
            representing the words in the question for each batch.

        Returns
        -------
        An output dictionary consisting of:
        start_logits: Variable(FloatTensor)
            The first element in the returned tuple. Variable(FloatTensor) of
            shape (batch_size, max_passage_size). Each value is the score
            assigned to a given token. Masked indices are assigned very
            small scores (-1e7).

        end_logits: Variable(FloatTensor)
            The second element in the returned tuple. Variable(FloatTensor) of
            shape (batch_size, max_passage_size). Each value is the score
            assigned to a given token. Masked indices are assigned very
            small scores (-1e7).

        softmax_start_logits: Variable(FloatTensor)
            The third element in the returned tuple. Variable(FloatTensor) of
            shape (batch_size, max_passage_size). Exactly the same as
            start_logits, but with a masked log softmax applied. Represents
            a probability distribution over the passage, indicating the
            probability that any given token is where the answer begins.
            Masked indices have probability mass of -inf.

        softmax_end_logits: Variable(FloatTensor)
            The fourth element in the returned tuple. Variable(FloatTensor) of
            shape (batch_size, max_passage_size). Exactly the same as
            start_logits, but with a masked log softmax applied. Represents
            a probability distribution over the passage, indicating the
            probability that any given token is where the answer end.
